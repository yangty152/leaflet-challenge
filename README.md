# leaflet-challenge
* leaflet-1: basic street map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. 
* Data set is from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
* Bubble size is Magnitude, and the color is the depth of the earthquakes.
* leaflet-2: similar to the basic map, but with multiple base map layers and two control layers which shows earthquaks, and also the Tectonic Plates.
